## About 
This project, Webbie, is about teaching the basics of web development in a fun and engaging way. We want to introduce students to HTML and CSS through an interactive platform that shows them step-by-step how to design the structure of a website and how to add customizations such as changing font size or font color, adding buttons, and embedding links or images.
